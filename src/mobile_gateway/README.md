# Helios mobile telemetry gateway

**Start here:** [Pranav’s complete Jetson-to-iPhone setup and handoff](PRANAV_SETUP.md).

A small ROS 2 Python package providing authenticated HTTP telemetry and opt-in managed runbook operations for a mobile client. By default only telemetry is enabled. An explicitly enabled operation manager can start/stop allowlisted ROS launch processes and run fixed save/recovery/diagnostic commands. It never accepts arbitrary shell input or submits navigation goals. No physical hardware was actuated during development. See [the operation catalog and API](OPERATIONS.md).

## Repository integration

The source audit identifies these interfaces:

| Input / existing capability | Repository evidence | Gateway use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/odometry/filtered`, `nav_msgs/msg/Odometry` | [EKF launch](../perception_pkg/sensor_fusion/launch/ekf.launch.py), [EKF config](../perception_pkg/sensor_fusion/config/ekf.yaml) | Pose and planar velocity |
| `/scan`, `sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan`, frame `laser` | [LiDAR launch](../perception_pkg/lidar/custom_config/launch/lidar.launch.py), [LiDAR config](../perception_pkg/lidar/custom_config/config/urg_node2.yaml) | Nearest valid return |
| `/map` and localization | [Mapping package](../mapping_localization_pkg/README.md) | Not exposed |
| Nav2 goals and `/cmd_vel` | [Navigation launch](../navigation_pkg/launch/navigation.launch.py), [navigation docs](../navigation_pkg/README.md) | Not exposed |

Subscriptions use ROS sensor-data QoS (best effort, volatile). Topic names are configurable via ROS parameters. Gateway freshness measures monotonic time since callback receipt, **not** the ROS message timestamp or a guarantee that the sensor measurement itself is current. Delayed or replayed ROS data can therefore appear fresh. Odometry is in the supplied odometry frame; it is not a map-relative location. The nearest return is a scan summary, not a collision or clearance guarantee.

## API version 1

`GET /v1/telemetry` with exactly one `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Paths are exact; no query parameters. Responses have `Content-Type: application/json`, `Cache-Control: no-store`, and close the connection. Suggested client polling: 2 Hz, one outstanding request, with a finite timeout and reconnect backoff. A telemetry-only disconnect has no robot-side action; an operation control lease expires without heartbeats and requests owned-process shutdown; clients must immediately mark their display disconnected and must not treat cached telemetry as live.

```json
{"api_version":1,"source":"ros2","odometry":{"available":true,"age_seconds":0.1,"frame_id":"odom","child_frame_id":"base_link","x":1.0,"y":2.0,"heading":0.3,"linear_x":0.2,"linear_y":0.0,"angular_z":0.1},"scan":{"available":true,"age_seconds":0.1,"frame_id":"laser","nearest_m":1.2}}
```

`source` is `ros2` for the ROS adapter and `fixture` for synthetic data; clients must label fixture data as simulated. This describes the adapter, not proof of physical hardware (ROS can replay bags).

Distances are meters, heading radians, linear velocity meters/second, angular velocity radians/second. Heading is yaw from the normalized quaternion. Numeric JSON values are finite. Missing data is `{"available":false}`; invalid or older-than-2-second data is `{"available":false,"age_seconds":...}` with no measurement fields. At exactly 2 seconds a valid sample remains available. A fresh scan with no valid finite in-range returns is available with `"nearest_m":null`; this does **not** mean the space is clear. Consumers must accept missing optional fields when unavailable and ignore unknown fields for future additive changes.

Invalid credentials return 401 (`unauthorized`); authenticated non-GET methods return 405 (`method_not_allowed`, `Allow: GET`); unknown paths return 404 (`not_found`). These errors contain no credentials. A HEAD response has no body. This telemetry endpoint does not command motion. The separately enabled [operation API](OPERATIONS.md) can launch motion-capable stacks and recovery services; it has an expiring control lease and best-effort graceful process shutdown. There is no emergency-stop, velocity, map-rendering, mission or navigation-goal API.

## ROS 2 deployment

On the robot's Linux host with its existing ROS 2 environment (the repository uses Jazzy), from the workspace root:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
rosdep install --from-paths src/mobile_gateway --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --packages-select mobile_gateway
source install/setup.bash
export HELIOS_GATEWAY_TOKEN="$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
ros2 run mobile_gateway mobile_gateway --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

Generate and securely retain this telemetry-only token; regenerating it invalidates the previous one when the gateway restarts. For the operation catalog and jobs, generate a **different** `HELIOS_OPERATOR_TOKEN` with the same random-token command and load it from a protected environment file. The operator token can also read telemetry, so the current one-token mobile client can use it when operated by a trusted controller; a read-only client gets only the telemetry token. Operation routes reject the telemetry token even when commands are enabled, and enabling commands without a separate operator token fails startup. Startup rejects tokens shorter than 32 ASCII non-whitespace characters or identical tokens. Do not commit them, put them in URLs, or paste them into logs. A service manager may load them from a permissions-restricted environment file; avoid command-line token arguments. Configure the same ROS domain and middleware environment as the publishers. Launch existing sensors separately according to their own operator procedures; starting this gateway alone yields unavailable telemetry.

Topic overrides:

```bash
ros2 run mobile_gateway mobile_gateway --ros-args \
  -p odometry_topic:=/odometry/filtered -p scan_topic:=/scan
```

Local verification from a shell that has the token:

```bash
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${HELIOS_GATEWAY_TOKEN}" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/telemetry
```

For off-host use, terminate trusted TLS at a reverse proxy on the robot. For example, an nginx `http` configuration fragment, with a certificate trusted by the phone and matching `robot.example.net`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name robot.example.net;
    ssl_certificate /etc/helios/tls/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/helios/tls/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    access_log off;
    client_header_timeout 5s;
    client_body_timeout 5s;
    client_max_body_size 1k;
    location = /v1/telemetry {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
        proxy_connect_timeout 2s;
        proxy_read_timeout 5s;
    }
    location / { return 404; }
}
```

Configure DNS/routing, install the certificate and proxy separately, and restrict inbound 443 to the intended trusted LAN/VPN. Keep port 8080 loopback-only. The mobile base URL is `https://robot.example.net`; do not disable certificate validation. There is no plaintext off-host recommendation. Non-loopback binding requires explicit `--behind-tls-proxy`; this flag acknowledges deployment responsibilities and does not implement TLS or a firewall. The Python server is intentionally small (8 concurrent clients, 3-second socket inactivity timeout, 5-second total request deadline), not a public Internet service. Reverse-proxy hardening and network policy remain deployment responsibilities.

## Local synthetic fixture and tests

These commands require Python 3 and no ROS installation. From the workspace root:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src/mobile_gateway python3 -m unittest discover -s src/mobile_gateway/test -v
export HELIOS_GATEWAY_TOKEN="$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
export HELIOS_OPERATOR_TOKEN="$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
PYTHONPATH=src/mobile_gateway python3 -m mobile_gateway.fixture --port 8080
```

The fixture continuously generates synthetic odometry and scan data using the same HTTP server and state validation as the ROS adapter. Its operation API requires the separate operator token and uses a simulated backend: services remain running and actions complete synthetically, with no subprocesses or files created. Configure an operations-capable fixture client with the operator token; it can also read telemetry. The fixture never imports ROS or contacts hardware. Use the loopback URL for a same-host development client; a phone requires the TLS deployment above. Stop with Ctrl-C. Never present fixture values as live robot measurements.

Tests exercise actual loopback sockets, authentication and duplicate headers, method/path rejection, disconnect recovery, socket timeout and slow-drip deadline/slot recovery, monotonic stale boundaries, quaternion normalization, finite-value rejection, and scan filtering/null semantics. Local tests do not prove ROS discovery/QoS, colcon installation on the robot, trusted TLS on a phone, real sensor freshness, or robot connectivity. Those require deployment validation by an operator. No hardware, map rendering, or navigation validation is claimed.
