"""Nav2 autonomous navigation for Helios: goal in, /cmd_vel out.

Runs ON TOP of a stack that is already up. It needs, in this order:

    1. low_level_control_pkg roboclaw_driver.launch.py   (consumes /cmd_vel)
    2. sensor_fusion bringup.launch.py                   (odom -> base_link, /scan)
    3. a map source owning map -> odom, exactly one of:
         slam_toolbox.launch.py            build a map and navigate in it
         amcl_localization.launch.py       navigate in a saved map
         rtabmap.launch.py publish_tf_map:=true

Nav2 publishes NO transforms. The EKF keeps odom -> base_link and the mapper
keeps map -> odom, exactly as before.

Six servers are launched, not the nine nav2_bringup would start. smoother_server,
waypoint_follower and docking_server are omitted because nothing here uses them
and this Jetson is already CPU-bound by the ZED. Add them when a use appears.

DO NOT run joy_teleop at the same time. Both publish /cmd_vel and the driver
takes whichever arrives last, which interleaves human and autonomous commands.
Teleop also has a deadman button; Nav2 does not. See the README.

Toggle with: rviz:=true autostart:=false params_file:=/custom/nav2.yaml

# Order matters: lifecycle_manager transitions these in sequence and STOPS at the
# first one that will not activate, leaving everything after it inactive.
#
# planner_server is therefore last of the movement-capable nodes. It carries the
# GLOBAL costmap, which blocks on map -> odom, so it cannot activate until
# something has localized the robot. Put it earlier and it takes the behaviors
# down with it: amcl_recovery then cannot drive the rover to localize it, and
# nothing ever localizes, which is a deadlock the robot cannot leave on its own.
#
# Verified live: behavior_server activates cleanly with no map -> odom at all.
# It declares global_frame: map but Spin and DriveOnHeading both work in
# local_frame: odom, so it never needs the map edge.
#
# Everything before planner_server needs only odom -> base_link, which the EKF
# publishes from the moment the sensors are up.
