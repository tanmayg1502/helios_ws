# navigation_pkg

Autonomous navigation: give Helios a goal pose, and it plans a route and drives
there while avoiding what it sees.

This package contains **no algorithms**. Every node it launches is an upstream
Nav2 server. What lives here is the configuration and launch wiring that makes
Nav2 work with *this* robot: a mecanum base that can strafe, an EKF that already
owns `odom -> base_link`, and a Jetson that is already busy.

**Read [the root README](../../README.md) first** for the system overview, and
[launch_helios.md](../../launch_helios.md) for how to run the whole stack.

> **Status: configured, not yet validated on a full drive.** Every server
> launches and reaches `active`, and the parameters below are reasoned from this
> robot's measured geometry and limits. Nothing here has been confirmed against
> a real goal-to-goal run, so treat the tuning values as starting points.

## Where it sits

Nav2 is the top layer. It consumes everything below it and drives everything
above nothing, because there is nothing above it.

**Nav2 publishes no transforms.** TF ownership is unchanged: the EKF keeps
`odom -> base_link`, whichever mapper is running keeps `map -> odom`.

## The mecanum decisions

Most Nav2 configurations you will find assume a differential-drive robot. Three
choices here exist specifically because Helios can strafe.

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `motion_model` | `"Omni"` | `DiffDrive` forbids `vy` outright, discarding the whole point of mecanum |
| `vy_std` / `vy_max` | 0.20 / 0.40 | The optimizer must be allowed to sample sideways motion |
| `PreferForwardCritic` | **omitted** | It penalises any motion that is not forward, which is a penalty on strafing |
| `PathAngleCritic.mode` | `1` | Mode 0 assumes a forward-facing preference; mode 1 has none |
| `use_final_approach_orientation` | `false` | The planner does not need to shape the final heading; MPPI can strafe into it |

`TwirlingCritic` is kept and weighted 10.0. Omni robots can rotate freely at any
moment, and without this they tend to spin while translating for no benefit.

## Files

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `config/nav2_params.yaml` | Every server's parameters, in one file |
| `launch/navigation.launch.py` | Starts 5 servers plus the lifecycle manager |
| `rviz/navigation.rviz` | Costmaps, plans, footprint, and the goal tool |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | Installs `config/`, `launch/`, `rviz/` into `share/` |
| `package.xml` | Metadata and dependencies |

### What gets launched, and what does not

`nav2_bringup` starts around nine servers. This package starts **five**, plus
the lifecycle manager:

| Node | Job |
|---|---|
| `controller_server` | MPPI local control, owns the local costmap |
| `planner_server` | SmacPlanner2D global planning, owns the global costmap |
| `behavior_server` | Recovery behaviors: spin, backup, drive_on_heading, wait |
| `bt_navigator` | Runs the behavior tree that sequences the above |
| `velocity_smoother` | Ramps `/cmd_vel_nav` into `/cmd_vel` |
| `lifecycle_manager_navigation` | Drives all five configure to activate |

Omitted: `smoother_server`, `waypoint_follower`, `docking_server`,
`collision_monitor`. Nothing uses them yet, and this Jetson already runs the ZED
at around 155% CPU. Add them when there is a reason.

`nav2_bringup` is **not** a dependency. `navigation.launch.py` wires the
lifecycle itself, the same way `amcl_localization.launch.py` does.

---

## Topic wiring

The controller does not talk to the motors directly. It is routed through the
smoother so the driver only ever receives ramped commands:

```
controller_server ──► /cmd_vel_nav ──► velocity_smoother ──► /cmd_vel
                                                                │
                                                                ▼
                                              roboclaw_driver_node
```

`/cmd_vel` is the topic `roboclaw_driver_node` already subscribes to, so nothing
in `low_level_control_pkg` changes.

> ### Do not run teleop and navigation at the same time
>
> `joy_teleop` also publishes `/cmd_vel`. Running both means the driver acts on
> whichever message arrived last, interleaving human and autonomous commands at
> 20 Hz.
>
> **There is also no deadman button in autonomous mode.** Teleop requires you to
> hold R for the rover to move. Nav2 does not. Keep a hand on the kill path and
> know that `Ctrl+C` on the navigation terminal stops new commands, after which
> the driver's own `cmd_timeout` (0.5 s) ramps the wheels to a stop.

## Key parameters

Geometry comes from `helios_description/urdf/base.xacro`. Re-measure there
first, then mirror it here.

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `footprint` | 0.38 x 0.38 m square | Wheels reach x = ±0.186, y = ±0.1875 |
| `inflation_radius` | 0.45 m | ~1.7x the 0.27 m circumscribed radius |
| `vx_max` / `vy_max` / `wz_max` | 0.40 m/s, 0.40 m/s, 0.80 rad/s | Matches `roboclaw.yaml` ceilings |
| `max_accel` | 0.80 m/s² | `drive_accel` 5000 counts/s² is ~0.98 m/s² |
| `resolution` | 0.05 m/cell | Matches `slam_toolbox.yaml` |

A rectangular footprint is used rather than `robot_radius` because a
circumscribing circle on this base is 0.27 m and would refuse gaps the rover
actually fits through.

### CPU, and what to turn up first

`batch_size` and `time_steps` are **reduced from the Nav2 defaults** (1000/40
instead of 2000/56) because of the ZED's load on this Jetson. Cost scales with
`batch_size * time_steps`.

| If | Then |
|---|---|
| The controller misses 20 Hz | Lower `batch_size` first, then `time_steps` |
| There is CPU headroom | Raise `batch_size` toward 2000; path quality improves |
| Paths clip corners | Raise `time_steps` for a longer horizon |

`CostCritic.consider_footprint` is `false`. Setting it `true` is exact rather
than using the inscribed-circle approximation, but it is markedly slower. Turn
it on only if the rover clips obstacles in tight spaces and you have the CPU.

## Build

```bash
cd ~/helios_ws
colcon build --packages-select navigation_pkg --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

This package installs config and launch files only, so the build itself needs
nothing. The servers it launches do:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-nav2-mppi-controller ros-jazzy-nav2-smac-planner \
                 ros-jazzy-nav2-bt-navigator ros-jazzy-nav2-behaviors \
                 ros-jazzy-nav2-velocity-smoother ros-jazzy-nav2-lifecycle-manager
```

All six are already present on this Jetson.

## Run

Nav2 sits on top of a running stack. Start these first, in this order:

```bash
# 1. motors
ros2 launch low_level_control_pkg roboclaw_driver.launch.py
# 2. sensors + EKF
ros2 launch sensor_fusion bringup.launch.py
# 3. a map source, exactly ONE of:
ros2 launch mapping_localization_pkg slam_toolbox.launch.py
ros2 launch mapping_localization_pkg amcl_localization.launch.py map:=<path>.yaml
# 4. navigation
ros2 launch navigation_pkg navigation.launch.py rviz:=true
```

| Argument | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `params_file` | this package's `nav2_params.yaml` | Point at an alternative param set |
| `autostart` | `true` | `false` leaves the servers unconfigured for manual transitions |
| `rviz` | `false` | Opens the navigation layout. Costs CPU; prefer a laptop. |

Then set a goal: in RViz use **Nav2 Goal**, or call the action directly:

```bash
ros2 action send_goal /navigate_to_pose nav2_msgs/action/NavigateToPose \
  "{pose: {header: {frame_id: map}, pose: {position: {x: 1.0, y: 0.0}, \
   orientation: {w: 1.0}}}}"
```

---

## Verify

**1. All five servers reached active.** This is the single most useful check:

```bash
ros2 lifecycle get /controller_server   # expect: active [3]
ros2 lifecycle get /planner_server
ros2 lifecycle get /bt_navigator
```

If the lifecycle manager logs `Failed to bring up all requested nodes`, a server
could not configure. The usual cause is a missing transform: the costmaps block
until `map -> odom -> base_link` is complete.

**2. Costmaps are populated.**

```bash
ros2 topic hz /global_costmap/costmap     # ~1 Hz
ros2 topic hz /local_costmap/costmap      # ~2 Hz
```

In RViz the local costmap should show inflation around the walls the laser sees.
An empty costmap next to a visible `/scan` means the `sensor_frame` or the
`observation_sources` topic is wrong.

**3. A plan is produced.** Set a goal and watch:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /plan --once      # the global path
ros2 topic hz /local_plan         # MPPI's chosen trajectory, ~20 Hz
```

**4. Commands actually reach the driver.**

```bash
ros2 topic hz /cmd_vel_nav        # controller output
ros2 topic hz /cmd_vel            # smoothed, what the driver consumes
```

If `/cmd_vel_nav` publishes but `/cmd_vel` does not, the smoother is not active.

**5. It strafes.** Give it a goal directly to one side in an open space. A
correctly configured omni setup will translate sideways rather than turning,
driving forward, and turning back. If it always turns first, `motion_model` is
not `Omni` or `PreferForwardCritic` has crept back in.

## Known limitations

| Limitation | Consequence |
|---|---|
| The laser plane sits **0.176 m above the ground** (`base_link` is 0.076 m up, `laser_mount_joint` adds 0.100 m) | Obstacles shorter than 17.6 cm are invisible. Nav2 will drive into them. |
| No `collision_monitor` | There is no independent last-resort stop below the controller |
| No ZED voxel layer | Depth is not used for obstacles; see below |
| Costmaps use `/scan` only | Glass and low-contrast surfaces the laser misses are not avoided |

The low-obstacle gap is the one that matters. The fix is a voxel layer fed by
`/zed/zed_node/point_cloud/cloud_registered`, which sees below the laser plane.
It is deliberately not enabled yet: reprocessing showed a camera-sourced grid
more than halved observed obstacles compared with the laser when used for
*mapping*, and the point cloud costs real CPU. For *navigation* the trade is
different, since the two sources would be additive rather than substitutes. It
is the obvious next addition.
