"""RTAB-Map (RGB-D + LiDAR registration, GTSAM pose-graph SLAM) for Helios.

Runs ALONGSIDE the sensor stack (sensor_fusion/bringup.launch.py) and, if you
want it, slam_toolbox.launch.py -- this does NOT own map->odom TF by default
(publish_tf_map:=false), so its 3D map/loop-closure quality can be validated
risk-free before anything is switched over to depend on it live.

Reuses the already-fused EKF odometry (/odometry/filtered) instead of
estimating its own visual odometry -- avoids running two competing pose
estimators. Fuses the Hokuyo scan alongside ZED RGB-D for registration
(Reg/Strategy=2 "VisIcp", passed via 'args' since it's one of RTAB-Map's own
internal parameters, not a ROS node parameter -- see `ros2 run rtabmap_slam
rtabmap --params` for the full list).

GTSAM is already the default pose-graph optimizer in this RTAB-Map build
(Optimizer/Strategy=2)

To later make this TF-authoritative (replacing slam_toolbox's map->odom):
publish_tf_map:=true, and stop running slam_toolbox.launch.py.

Each run gets its own database under rtabmap/maps/ (named by 'run_name',
default a timestamp). The 3D map lives entirely inside that .db (the whole
SLAM session: keyframes, pose graph, loop closures) -- inspect it afterward
with rtabmap-databaseViewer.

Toggle with: publish_tf_map:=true rviz:=true rtabmap_viz:=true localization:=true
